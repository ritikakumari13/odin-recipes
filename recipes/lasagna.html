    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Oil a 9×13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Roast the vegetables: Place the mushrooms, red bell pepper, zucchini, and onion on the baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Roast for 20-25 minutes until tender and browned around the edges. Reduce the oven temperature to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and toss with a drizzle of olive oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Prepare the ricotta filling: In a large bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, garlic, lemon zest, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna: Spread 1 cup of marinara sauce at the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Add a layer of noodles, followed by half the ricotta mixture. Spread evenly, then arrange half the spinach on top. Add half the roasted vegetables and dot with ⅔ cup of marinara sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layering: Add another layer of noodles, followed by the remaining ricotta, spinach, vegetables, and another ⅔ cup of sauce. Top with the final layer of noodles.</li>
        <li>Add the cheese topping: Spread the remaining ⅔ cup marinara over the pasta, then evenly sprinkle with mozzarella and pecorino cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake: Place the lasagna in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, or until the cheese is browned and bubbling.</li>
        <li>Rest and serve: Let the lasagna stand for 20 minutes before garnishing with fresh basil or parsley, slicing, and serving.</li>
    </ol>
